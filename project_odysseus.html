    <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
    <p>PROJECT Odysseus is a sequel to Create Techified, where excess quantum energy has ended all life on the planet. It's YOUR mission to bring life back to the planet and save the day.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>1. Post-Apocalyptic World:</strong> A planet ravaged by quantum energy - no life, no breathable air, not even water remains. The fate of the planet rests in your hands.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Reclaim the Planet:</strong> Master Spatial Technology and advanced tools to restore MASSAGE-2(A-B)b to its former glory.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Sequel Experience:</strong> Continue after the events of Create: Techified, where the past pioneers left a bit of a mess for you to clean up.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you played Create: Techified and Satisfactory, and really liked the idea of a story factory-building game, I recommend you give PROJECT Odysseus a try!</p>
