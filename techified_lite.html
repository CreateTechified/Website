    <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
    <p>Create: Techified Lite is a trimmed down version of the Create: Techified modpack.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>1. Optimized Performance:</strong> With actually less performance mods, this version mystically runs better!</p>
    <p><strong>2. Same Endgame Experience:</strong> All of Techified, without most of the fluff.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Server-Friendly:</strong> Made specifically for a scuffed server, but works great for flying solo too.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Custom Content:</strong> Mostly the same content, just tweaked to work with the limited mod availability.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you were wanting to play Techified, but your computer is from the stone age, this version.. might help.</p>
